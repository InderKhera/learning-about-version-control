# learning-about-version-control
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control is that you are able to collaborate on big projucts with team members without having to be in the same location.

What find most challenging is when there may be a merge conflict due to lack of communication causing time and energy going into solving the conflict.
